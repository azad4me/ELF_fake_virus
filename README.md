This is a learning project aimed for training on the possible behaviour of C-developed viruses. 

## A study example for Linux machines
* A basic virus sample  aimed for Linux machines using ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) concepts
* The virus copies itself to all binary files from a specified directory and avoids reinfecting itself.
