# Ethical hacking. Building Applications
This a learning project aimed for training on the possible behaviour of C-developed viruses. 

## A study example
* A basic virus sample (learning purposes, do not shoot me!) aimed for Linux machines (where ELF file signatures matter). 
* The virus copies itself to all binary files from a specified directory and avoids reinfecting itself.
